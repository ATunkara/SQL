In this SQL, I am pulling data from multiple tables to query the orders cutomers have placed for products in different months.

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSALES
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LIMIT 10;

-- query 1, How many many unique orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID != 'ORDER ID';

-- query 2, How many of those orders placed in January were for Iphone's?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID != 'ORDER ID';

-- query 3, Select the account numbers for all the customers who has placed an order in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id != 'ORDER ID';

-- query 4, What is the cheapest product sold in January, and what's the price of that product?
-- inner query
SELECT MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- outer query
SELECT distinct Product, 
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN ();

-- inner and ourter query joined
SELECT distinct Product, 
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- query 5, What's the total revenue of each product sold in January?

SELECT Product,
 (SUM(Quantity) * price) 'total'
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid != 'ORDER ID'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY total asc;

-- query 6, What products were sold February, and delivered to 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many were sold and total revenue?

SELECT Product, 
SUM(Quantity), 
(SUM(Quantity) * price) AS 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%548 linc%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue asc;

-- query 7, How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Feb, What's the average spent?
SELECT COUNT(acctnum), 
ROUND(AVG(Quantity * price)) AS 'Total Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id != 'ORDER ID';

-- Query 8, List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT distinct Product,
SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
